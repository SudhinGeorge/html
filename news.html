    		<h3><q>ANYTHING HUMAN’S DON’T WANT TO DO, OPTIMUS WILL DO</q> – ELON MUSK</h3>

    		<p><b>On August 19, 2021</b>, at the <i>Tesla AI day</i>, <b>Elon Musk</b> announced he was working on a humanoid robot — at the time — called the <strong>Tesla Bot</strong>. According to the Tesla CEO, the robot will run on the same AI used by <i> Tesla’s autonomous vehicle fleet</i>, and will help humans by taking care of unsafe, repetitive, and boring everyday tasks. Almost a year later, Elon Musk talked about the robot again at the Cyber Rodeo event in Texas, this time under the <i>Optimus Sub-Prime</i> nickname. He explained the priority he has given the project, stating it will be ready for <em>production in 2023.</em></p>

    		<p><i><q>Anything humans don’t want to do, Optimus will do,</q></i> <b>Musk Said on stage.</b> <i><q>It may be hard to imagine it, but as you see Optimus’ develop — we will make sure it is safe, no terminator stuff or that kind of thing — how it’s really going to transform the world to a degree even greater than the cars. I think we have a shot at being in production for version one, hopefully next year.</q></i></p>

    		<p>Currently, Tesla hasn’t unveiled a working prototype of the robot, and it is not clear at what stage the development is at. The robot shown at the <b>Cyber Rodeo event</b> features the same proportions as humans: 
    		<i>it is 5-foot-8 (172 cm) tall, 125 pounds (56 kg) heavy.</i> This allows it to operate in an environment made by humans, for humans. In a conversation with <b>Mathias Döpfner, CEO of Axel Springer,</b> Musk explained his plans further, saying that the robot will be a general focused humanoid, and that he hopes we will be able to download our brain characteristics into it, including our personality.</p>

    		<p><i><q>We could download the things that we believe make ourselves so unique,</q></i> <b>Musk continued.</b> <i><q>Now, of course, if you’re not in that body anymore, that is definitely going to be a difference, but as far as preserving our memories, our personality, I think we could do that.</q></i></p>

    		<h2><u>Humanoid Robotics</u></h2>
    		<p>Humanoid robotics is an emerging and challenging research field, which has received significant attention during the past years and will continue to play a central role in robotics research and in many applications of the 21st century. Regardless of the application area, one of the common problems tackled in humanoid robotics is the understanding of human-like information processing and the underlying mechanisms of the human brain in dealing with the real world. Ambitious goals have been set for future humanoid robotics. They are expected to serve as companions and assistants for humans in daily life and as ultimate helpers in man-made and natural disasters. In 2050, a team of humanoid robots soccer players shall win against the winner of most recent World Cup. DARPA announced recently the next Grand Challenge in robotics: building robots which do things like humans in a world made for humans.</p>

    		<p>Considerable progress has been made in humanoid research resulting in a number of humanoid robots able to move and perform well-designed tasks. Over the past decade in humanoid research, an encouraging spectrum of science and technology has emerged that leads to the development of highly advanced humanoid mechatronic systems endowed with rich and complex sensorimotor capabilities. Of major importance for advances of the field is without doubt the availability of reproducible humanoid robots systems, which have been used in the last years as common hardware and software platforms to support humanoids research. Many technical innovations and remarkable results by universities, research institutions and companies are visible. The major activities of the TC are reflected by the firmly established annual IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots, which is the internationally recognized prime event of the humanoid robotics community. The conference is sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. The level of interest in humanoid robotics research continues to grow, which is evidenced by the increasing number of submitted papers to this conference.</p>

    		<h2><u>Tesla</u></h2>

    		<p>Tesla, is an American automotive electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Austin, Texas. Tesla designs and manufactures electric cars, battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies and remains the world's most valuable automaker with a market capitalization of more than US $1 trillion. The company had the most worldwide sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 23% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market and 16% of the plug-in market (which includes plug-in hybrids) in 2020. Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 3.99 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2021.Founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment, X.com co-founder Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company and its chairman. He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2009. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the Model Y crossover in 2020. The Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[8] Tesla's global sales were 936,222 cars in 2021, a 87% increase over the previous year,[9] and cumulative sales totaled 2.3 million cars at the end of 2021.[10] In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization reached $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history.Tesla has been the subject of many lawsuits and controversies arising from statements and acts of CEO Elon Musk and from allegations of creative accounting, whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, and unresolved and dangerous technical problems with their products. In September 2021, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered Tesla to submit data pertaining to all sold US vehicles equipped with Autopilot following the agency's investigations into traffic deaths involving the use of Autopilot.</p>

    		<p>On January 10, 2020, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $86 billion, breaking the record for greatest valuation of any American automaker.[61] On June 10, 2020, Tesla's market capitalization surpassed those of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen combined.[62] The next month, Tesla reached a valuation of $206 billion, surpassing Toyota's $202 billion to become the world's most valuable automaker by market capitalization.[63] On August 31, 2020, following this increase in value, Tesla had a 5-for-1 stock split. From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four profitable quarters in a row for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500. Tesla was added to the index on December 21, 2020. It was the largest company ever added, and the sixth-largest company in the index at the time of its inclusion. As investors tried to buy more shares as a result of this inclusion, some analysts, such as J.P. Morgan's Ryan Brinkman, suggested investors exercise caution as Tesla was "dramatically" overvalued. Throughout 2020, the share price of Tesla increased 740%,[68] and on January 26, 2021, its market capitalization reached $848 billion, more than the next nine largest automakers combined and making it the 5th most valuable company in the US. From 2015 to 2020, Tesla went on an acquisition spree, buying a handful of little-known companies: Riviera Tool, Grohmann Engineering, Perbix, Compass Automation, Hibar Systems, and German ATW Automation to advance Tesla's expertise in automation, along with Maxwell Technologies and SilLion to add to Tesla's abilities in battery technology.[72][73] Grohmann (renamed Tesla Grohmann Automation) and Maxwell would continue to operate as subsidiary companies, while the rest would be merged into Tesla. In July 2021, Musk acknowledged that Tesla had sold Maxwell to the former VP of sales for Maxwell. In January 2020, Tesla donated 5 million Yuan ($723,000) to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China. In October 2020, Tesla told Electrek that they had dissolved their public relations (PR) department (with the exception of a few PR managers representing Tesla's European and Asian markets), becoming the first automaker to do so.</p>
